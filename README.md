# DHN-optimization
This repository contains all codes that are used in my Master Thesis for TU Delft. The objective of the thesis is to optimize district heating networks based on accurate spatial data, while researching the effect of choosing optimization objectives.

The repository contains a script that allows to generate streets network, with an underlying district heating network problem with accurate geospatial street networks. The district heating network problem may be made anywhere in the world.

Next to that, there is a function that calculates the cost and diameters of the pipelines.  Also there is a function given that calculates the thermal losses of a district heating network. 

Last, there is a script that applies an Edge-Turn heuristic and high-valency shuffle metaheuristic on district heating networks.
